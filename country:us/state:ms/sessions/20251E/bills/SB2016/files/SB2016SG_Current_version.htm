agencys responsibility to ensure that funds required to be appropriated for
Personal Services for Fiscal Year 2027 do not exceed Fiscal Year 2026 funds
appropriated for that purpose unless programs or positions are added to the

Services for Fiscal Year 2027, when annualized, the State Personnel Board

Fiscal Year 2026. These funds are to be utilized to increase the number of
filled headcounts that were authorized but unfilled as of the last day of
Fiscal Year 2025. If the agency fills additional headcounts after May 1, 2025,
until the end of Fiscal Year 2025, the amount of available Vacancy Funding may
be proportionally reduced to reflect the updated number of filled headcounts.

increase headcounts and not for promotions, title changes, in-range salary
adjustments, or any other mechanism for increasing salaries for current
employees. </span></p>

without written approval from the Department of Finance and Administration. The
Department of Finance and Administration shall not provide written approval to
escalate any funds for salaries and/or headcounts without proof of availability
of new or additional funds above the appropriated level. Unless specifically
noted, all Fiscal Year 2025 escalated headcounts have been accounted for and
shall be converted to authorized time-limited headcounts.</span></p>
