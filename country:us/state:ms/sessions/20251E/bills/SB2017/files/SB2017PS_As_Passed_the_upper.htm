Fiscal Year 2025. If the agency fills additional headcounts after May 1, 2025,
until the end of Fiscal Year 2025, the amount of available Vacancy Funding may
be proportionally reduced to reflect the updated number of filled headcounts.

reimbursements for actual expenses incurred by the Office of State Aid Road
Construction for administering and providing engineering services to political
