until the end of Fiscal Year 2025, the amount of available Vacancy Funding may

of civil law, to the official employing or having the right of employment or
selection thereof, except that when the relationship is by affinity and the
person is dead through whom the relationship was established, this rule shall
not apply.  In the event of any such payment, then the official or person
approving and making such payment shall be liable to return to the State of
Mississippi and to pay into the State Treasury to the credit of the General
Fund three (3) times any such amount so paid to be recovered at suit by the
