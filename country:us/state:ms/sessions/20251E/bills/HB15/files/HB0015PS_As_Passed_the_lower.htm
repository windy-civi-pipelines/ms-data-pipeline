agencys responsibility to ensure that funds required to be appropriated for
Personal Services for Fiscal Year 2027 do not exceed Fiscal Year 2026 funds
appropriated for that purpose unless programs or positions are added to the
agencys Fiscal Year 2026 budget by the Mississippi Legislature. </span></p>

Services for Fiscal Year 2027, when annualized, the State Personnel Board
shall process no salary actions until such time as the requirements of the

Fiscal Year 2025. If the agency fills additional headcounts after May 1, 2025,
until the end of Fiscal Year 2025, the amount of available Vacancy Funding may
be proportionally reduced to reflect the updated number of filled headcounts.
The agency shall be responsible for ensuring that Vacancy Funding is used to
increase headcounts and not for promotions, title changes, in-range salary
adjustments, or any other mechanism for increasing salaries for current
employees. </span></p>

Department of Finance and Administration shall not provide written approval to
escalate any funds for salaries and/or headcounts without proof of availability
of new or additional funds above the appropriated level. Unless specifically
noted, all Fiscal Year 2025 escalated headcounts have been accounted for and
shall be converted to authorized time-limited headcounts.</span></p>
