SECTION 2.  The following sum, or so much thereof as may be necessary, is hereby appropriated out of any money in any special fund in the State Treasury to the credit of the Office of the Attorney General which is comprised of special source funds collected by or otherwise available to the office, for the purpose of defraying the expenses of the office for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2025, and ending June 30, 2026.................................................. ............................................ $ 12,504,164.00. SECTION 3. Of the funds appropriated under the provisions of this act, not more than the following amount of funds, with the exception of the provisions in this section, shall be expended only for Personal Services, which includes Vacancy Funding, for the following authorized number of employment headcount: FUNDING: General Funds:              $  25,895,719.00 Special Funds:              $   4,824,287.00 Total Funds:                $  30,720,006.00 PERSONAL SERVICES: Employee Salaries, Wages, and Fringe Benefits:           $  29,366,566.00 Progressions:               $ 0.00 Vacancy Funding:            $    1,353,440.00 Total Personal Services:     $  30,720,006.00 AUTHORIZED HEADCOUNT: Permanent: 91 Time-Limited:                209 As used in this section, the term Personal Services shall mean funds provided under the major object of expenditure category Personal Services for Salaries, Wages, and Fringe Benefits.  Funds in this category shall not be transferred to any other category. It is the intention of the Legislature to ensure compliance with the Variable Compensation Plan, as outlined in Section 25-9-147, Mississippi Code of 1972. Payment from these funds shall be in accordance with the Variable Compensation Plan promulgated by the Mississippi State Personnel Board. It is the Legislatures intention that no employees salary falls below the minimum salary established by the Mississippi State Personnel Board. The State Personnel Board shall determine and publish the projected annual cost of Personal Services based on monthly and year-to-date payroll expenditures in compliance with the provisions of this act. With the funds herein appropriated, it shall be the agencys responsibility to ensure that no single personnel action or combination of personnel actions, when annualized, exceeds the Fiscal Year 2026 appropriation for Personal Services with the exception of escalated funds. Further, it shall be the agencys responsibility to ensure that funds required to be appropriated for Personal Services for Fiscal Year 2027 do not exceed Fiscal Year 2026 funds appropriated for that purpose unless programs or positions are added to the agencys Fiscal Year 2026 budget by the Mississippi Legislature. If, at the time the agency takes any action to change Personal Services, the State Personnel Board determines that the agency has taken or will take an action that would cause the agency to exceed the funds appropriated in this act when annualized for Fiscal Year 2026 or increase the need for Personal Services for Fiscal Year 2027, when annualized, the State Personnel Board shall process no salary actions until such time as the requirements of the provisions of this section are met with the exception of new hires determined to be essential for the agency. When used in this section, Vacancy Funding shall mean funds included in the Total Personal Services amount listed above and designated for approved vacancies in Fiscal Year 2026. These funds are to be utilized to increase the number of filled headcounts that were authorized but unfilled as of the last day of Fiscal Year 2025. If the agency fills additional headcounts after May 1, 2025, until the end of Fiscal Year 2025, the amount of available Vacancy Funding may be proportionally reduced to reflect the updated number of filled headcounts. The agency shall be responsible for ensuring that Vacancy Funding is used to increase headcounts and not for promotions, title changes, in-range salary adjustments, or any other mechanism for increasing salaries for current employees. Any transfers or escalations shall be made in accordance with the terms, conditions, and procedures established by law or allowable under the terms set forth within this act. The State Personnel Board shall not escalate positions without written approval from the Department of Finance and Administration. The Department of Finance and Administration shall not provide written approval to escalate any funds for salaries and/or headcounts without proof of availability of new or additional funds above the appropriated level. Unless specifically noted, all Fiscal Year 2025 escalated headcounts have been accounted for and shall be converted to authorized time-limited headcounts. No general funds authorized to be expended herein shall be used to replace federal funds and/or other special funds used for salaries authorized under the provisions of this act and which are withdrawn and no longer available. None of the funds herein appropriated shall be used in violation of the Internal Revenue Services Publication 15-A relating to the reporting of income paid to contract employees, as interpreted by the Office of the State Auditor. If the agencys total authorized headcount decreases from Fiscal Year 2025 to Fiscal Year 2026, it will be the agencys discretion as to what headcounts are removed. SECTION 4.  It is the intention of the Legislature that the Office of the Attorney General shall maintain complete accounting and personnel records related to the expenditure of all funds appropriated under this act and that such records shall be in the same format and level of detail as maintained for Fiscal Year 2025.  It is further the intention of the Legislature that the agency's budget request for Fiscal Year 2027 shall be submitted to the Joint Legislative Budget Committee in a format and level of detail comparable to the format and level of detail provided during the Fiscal Year 2026 budget request process. SECTION 5.  In compliance with the "Mississippi Performance Budget and Strategic Planning Act of 1994," it is the intent of the Legislature that the funds provided herein shall be utilized in the most efficient and effective manner possible to achieve the intended mission of this agency.  Based on the funding authorized, this agency shall make every effort to attain the targeted performance measures provided below: FY2026 Performance Measures                                       Target Supportive Services Cost of Support Services as Percent of Budget                                            6.00 Training Ratings of Continuing Legal Education Training Presentation by Participants              95.00 Ratings of CRIMES System Training Presentation by Participants                       0.00 Litigation Minimum Affirmations of Criminal Convictions               93 Minimum Affirmations of Death Penalty Appeals                                             95 Minimum Denial of Relief in Federal Habeas Corpus                                       100 Minimum Pos Results of Civil Cases                        96 Percent Change of Affirmations of Criminal Convictions Attained                      0.00 Percent Change of Death Penalty Review Cases Affirmed                                     0.00 Percent of Change of Appeals for Relief in Federal Habeas Corpus Cases Denied               0.00 Percent Change of Positive Results from Civil Cases                                        0.00 Opinions Percent Assigned to Attorneys in 3 Days or Less                                         100.00 Percent of Opinions Completed in 30 Days or Less                                          90.00 Percent Change of Opinion Requests Assigned to Attorneys within 3 Days or Less                                              0.00 Percent Change of Opinion Requests Completed within 30 Days or Less                   0.00 State Agency Contracts Percent of Good and Excellent Ratings for Legal Services                               100.00 Percent Change of Good/Excellent Ratings for Legal Services                                 0.00 Insurance Integrity Enforcement Minimum Positive Results of Workers' Compensation Cases                                   99 Minimum Positive Results of Insurance Cases                99 Percent Change of Positive Results of Workers' Compensation Insurance Fraud               5.00 Percent Change of Positive Results of Other Insurance Cases                              0.00 Other Mandated Programs Medicaid Fraud Convictions vs Dispositions                100 Medicaid Abuse Convictions vs Dispositions                 92 Minimum Defendants Convicted after Indictments (PID)                                    90 Response to Consumer Complaints (Days)                     5 Average Number of Days to Respond to Consumer Complaints                                   5 Percent Change of Medicaid Fraud Convictions vs Dispositions                        0.00 Percent Change of Medicaid Abuse Convictions vs Dispositions                        3.00 Percent Change of Defendants Convicted After Indictment                                   0.00 Crime Victims Compensation Percent of Claims Processed in 12 Weeks or Less                                          75.00 Percent Change of Claims Processed Timely                0.00 Telephone "no-call" Number of No-Call Complaints                          30,000 Registered Telephone Solicitors (Number of)                60 Total Telephone Customers Served (Number of)           30,000 Solicitors Accessed Penalties                              1 Penalties Collected                                10,000.00 A reporting of the degree to which the performance targets set above have been or are being achieved shall be provided in the agency's budget request submitted to the Joint Legislative Budget Committee for Fiscal Year 2027.
