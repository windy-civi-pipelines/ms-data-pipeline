<p class=MsoNormal>By: Representative Calvert</p>

<h1 align=center style='text-align:center'>House Resolution 3</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>A RESOLUTION COMMENDING AND CONGRATULATING THE WEST
LAUDERDALE HIGH SCHOOL KNIGHTS BASEBALL TEAM UPON WINNING THE MISSISSIPPI HIGH
SCHOOL ACTIVITIES ASSOCIATION CLASS 4A BASEBALL STATE CHAMPIONSHIP.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'>     WHEREAS, the West Lauderdale
High School Knights Baseball Team captured the Mississippi High School
Athletics Association (MHSAA) Class 4A Baseball State Championship, its first
title since 2021, and its 16th overall, the most in MHSAA; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'>     WHEREAS, the Knights (32-7)
won Game 1 on May 20, 2025, 2-1, and fell to the Purvis High School Tornadoes
in the second, 4-3, on May 22, 2025, but the team held on and reigned
victorious against Purvis 3-2 on May 23, 2025, to win the MHSAA 4A state
championship at Trustmark Park in Game 3; and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'>     WHEREAS, West Lauderdale's Sophomore

allowed one hit and no runs, while winning the series MVP; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'>     WHEREAS, West Lauderdale
scored one run in the first inning on a sacrifice fly, but a throwing error to
home from starting Purvis pitcher Jacob Parker allowed two runs to score, and
Purvis tried to rally in the top of the seventh and scored two runs, but that
is all the Tornadoes could muster; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'>     WHEREAS, Coach Jason Smith
said the pitching and stadium were a testament to why all three games were
decided by one run; and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'>     WHEREAS, the Knights have
been supported in their athletic endeavors and can attribute much of their
success to the administration, staff, parents, fans and overall supporters
whose encouragement has remained fervent throughout the season; and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'>     WHEREAS, the Knights have
developed a winning and cooperative spirit and a high degree of sportsmanship,
and their activities and attitude reflect great credit upon each team member,
including:  Hunter Russell, Xavier Thompson, Dalyn Marshall, Cooper Rainer,
Cody Pigford, Zayden Moore, Ridge Brown, Landry Maxwell, Carter Horton, Chris
Rush, Braydn Warren, Cole Garrison, Tanner Spears, Shelton Cole, Rylan Kennedy,

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'>     WHEREAS, it is the policy of
the House of Representatives to recognize and commend excellence, especially
when evidenced by the youth of our state, such as the West Lauderdale High
School Knights Baseball Team, who are its future:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'>     NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT
RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI, That we
commend and congratulate the West Lauderdale High School Knights Baseball Team
for winning the Mississippi High School Athletics Association Class 4A Baseball
State Championship, and extend best wishes for continued success in all their
future endeavors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'>     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That
copies of this resolution be furnished to the West Lauderdale High School
Knights Baseball Team, and to members of the Capitol Press Corps. </p>
