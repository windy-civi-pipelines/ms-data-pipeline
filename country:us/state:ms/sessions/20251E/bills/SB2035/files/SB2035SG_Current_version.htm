agencys responsibility to ensure that funds required to be appropriated for Personal

appropriated for that purpose unless programs or positions are added to the
agencys Fiscal Year 2026 budget by the Mississippi Legislature. </span></p>

action that would cause the agency to exceed the funds appropriated in this act

Services for Fiscal Year 2027, when annualized, the State Personnel Board
shall process no salary actions until such time as the requirements of the

used in this section, Vacancy Funding shall mean funds included in the Total
Personal Services amount listed above and designated for approved vacancies in
Fiscal Year 2026. These funds are to be utilized to increase the number of filled
headcounts that were authorized but unfilled as of the last day of Fiscal Year
2025. If the agency fills additional headcounts after May 1, 2025, until the
end of Fiscal Year 2025, the amount of available Vacancy Funding may be
proportionally reduced to reflect the updated number of filled headcounts. The
agency shall be responsible for ensuring that Vacancy Funding is used to
increase headcounts and not for promotions, title changes, in-range salary
adjustments, or any other mechanism for increasing salaries for current
employees. </span></p>

transfers or escalations shall be made in accordance with the terms,
conditions, and procedures established by law or allowable under the terms set
forth within this act. The State Personnel Board shall not escalate positions
without written approval from the Department of Finance and Administration. The
Department of Finance and Administration shall not provide written approval to
escalate any funds for salaries and/or headcounts without proof of availability
of new or additional funds above the appropriated level. Unless specifically
noted, all Fiscal Year 2025 escalated headcounts have been accounted for and
shall be converted to authorized time-limited headcounts.</span></p>
