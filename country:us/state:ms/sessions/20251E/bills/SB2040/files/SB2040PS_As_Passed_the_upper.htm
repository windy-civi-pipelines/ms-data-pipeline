used in this section, the term Personal Services shall mean funds provided
under the major object of expenditure category Personal Services for Salaries,

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'><span style='color:black'>     It
is the intention of the Legislature to ensure compliance with the Variable
Compensation Plan, as outlined in Section 25-9-147, Mississippi Code of 1972.
Payment from these funds shall be in accordance with the Variable Compensation
Plan promulgated by the Mississippi State Personnel Board. It is the
Legislatures intention that no employees salary falls below the minimum
salary established by the Mississippi State Personnel Board.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'><span style='color:black'>     The
State Personnel Board shall determine and publish the projected annual cost of

the funds herein appropriated, it shall be the agencys responsibility to
ensure that no single personnel action or combination of personnel actions,
when annualized, exceeds the Fiscal Year 2026 appropriation for Personal
Services with the exception of escalated funds. Further, it shall be the
agencys responsibility to ensure that funds required to be appropriated for
Personal Services for Fiscal Year 2027 do not exceed Fiscal Year 2026 funds
appropriated for that purpose unless programs or positions are added to the
agencys Fiscal Year 2026 budget by the Mississippi Legislature. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'><span style='color:black'>     If,
at the time the agency takes any action to change Personal Services, the
State Personnel Board determines that the agency has taken or will take an
action that would cause the agency to exceed the funds appropriated in this act
when annualized for Fiscal Year 2026 or increase the need for Personal Services
for Fiscal Year 2027, when annualized, the State Personnel Board shall process
no salary actions until such time as the requirements of the provisions of this
section are met with the exception of new hires determined to be essential for
the agency.</span></p>

used in this section, Vacancy Funding shall mean funds included in the Total
Personal Services amount listed above and designated for approved vacancies in
Fiscal Year 2026. These funds are to be utilized to increase the number of
filled headcounts that were authorized but unfilled as of the last day of
Fiscal Year 2025. If the agency fills additional headcounts after May 1, 2025,
until the end of Fiscal Year 2025, the amount of available Vacancy Funding may
be proportionally reduced to reflect the updated number of filled headcounts.
The agency shall be responsible for ensuring that Vacancy Funding is used to
increase headcounts and not for promotions, title changes, in-range salary
adjustments, or any other mechanism for increasing salaries for current
employees. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'><span style='color:black'>     Any
transfers or escalations shall be made in accordance with the terms,
conditions, and procedures established by law or allowable under the terms set
forth within this act. The State Personnel Board shall not escalate positions
without written approval from the Department of Finance and Administration. The
Department of Finance and Administration shall not provide written approval to
escalate any funds for salaries and/or headcounts without proof of availability
of new or additional funds above the appropriated level. Unless specifically
noted, all Fiscal Year 2025 escalated headcounts have been accounted for and
shall be converted to authorized time-limited headcounts.<u>  </u></span></p>

general funds authorized to be expended herein shall be used to replace federal
funds and/or other special funds used for salaries authorized under the
provisions of this act and which are withdrawn and no longer available. </span></p>
