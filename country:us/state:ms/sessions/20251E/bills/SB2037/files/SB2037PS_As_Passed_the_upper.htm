<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'><span style='color:black'>     As
used in this section, the term Personal Services shall mean funds provided
under the major object of expenditure category Personal Services for Salaries,

is the intention of the Legislature to ensure compliance with the Variable
Compensation Plan, as outlined in Section 25-9-147, Mississippi Code of 1972.
Payment from these funds shall be in accordance with the Variable Compensation
Plan promulgated by the Mississippi State Personnel Board. It is the
Legislatures intention that no employees salary falls below the minimum
salary established by the Mississippi State Personnel Board.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'><span style='color:black'>     The
State Personnel Board shall determine and publish the projected annual cost of
Personal Services based on monthly and year-to-date payroll expenditures in

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'><span style='color:black'>     With
the funds herein appropriated, it shall be the agencys responsibility to
ensure that no single personnel action or combination of personnel actions,
when annualized, exceeds the Fiscal Year 2026 appropriation for Personal
Services with the exception of escalated funds. Further, it shall be the
agencys responsibility to ensure that funds required to be appropriated for
Personal Services for Fiscal Year 2027 do not exceed Fiscal Year 2026 funds
appropriated for that purpose unless programs or positions are added to the
agencys Fiscal Year 2026 budget by the Mississippi Legislature. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'><span style='color:black'>     If,
at the time the agency takes any action to change Personal Services, the
State Personnel Board determines that the agency has taken or will take an
action that would cause the agency to exceed the funds appropriated in this act
when annualized for Fiscal Year 2026 or increase the need for Personal
Services for Fiscal Year 2027, when annualized, the State Personnel Board
shall process no salary actions until such time as the requirements of the
provisions of this section are met with the exception of new hires determined
to be essential for the agency.</span></p>

used in this section, Vacancy Funding shall mean funds included in the Total
Personal Services amount listed above and designated for approved vacancies in
Fiscal Year 2026. These funds are to be utilized to increase the number of
filled headcounts that were authorized but unfilled as of the last day of
Fiscal Year 2025. If the agency fills additional headcounts after May 1, 2025,
until the end of Fiscal Year 2025, the amount of available Vacancy Funding may
be proportionally reduced to reflect the updated number of filled headcounts.
The agency shall be responsible for ensuring that Vacancy Funding is used to
increase headcounts and not for promotions, title changes, in-range salary
adjustments, or any other mechanism for increasing salaries for current
employees. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'><span style='color:black'>     Any
transfers or escalations shall be made in accordance with the terms,
conditions, and procedures established by law or allowable under the terms set
forth within this act. The State Personnel Board shall not escalate positions
without written approval from the Department of Finance and Administration. The
Department of Finance and Administration shall not provide written approval to
escalate any funds for salaries and/or headcounts without proof of availability
of new or additional funds above the appropriated level. Unless specifically
noted, all Fiscal Year 2025 escalated headcounts have been accounted for and
shall be converted to authorized time-limited headcounts.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'><span style='color:black'>     No
general funds authorized to be expended herein shall be used to replace federal
funds and/or other special funds used for salaries authorized under the
provisions of this act and which are withdrawn and no longer available.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'><span style='color:black'>     None
of the funds herein appropriated shall be used in violation of the Internal
Revenue Services Publication 15-A relating to the reporting of income paid to
contract employees, as interpreted by the Office of the State Auditor.</span></p>

the agencys total authorized headcount decreases from Fiscal Year 2025 to
Fiscal Year 2026, it will be the agencys discretion as to what headcounts are
removed.</span></p>

intention of the Legislature that the Office of the Secretary of State shall
maintain complete accounting and personnel records related to the expenditure
of all funds appropriated under this act and that such records shall be in the
same format and level of detail as maintained for Fiscal Year 2025.  It is
further the intention of the Legislature that the agency's budget request for
Fiscal Year 2027 shall be submitted to the Joint Legislative Budget Committee
in a format and level of detail comparable to the format and level of detail
provided during the Fiscal Year 2026 budget request process.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'><b>     SECTION 5.</b>  None of
the funds appropriated by this act shall be expended for any purpose that is
not actually required or necessary for performing any of the powers or duties
of the Office of the Secretary of State that are authorized by the Mississippi
Constitution of 1890, state or federal law, or rules or regulations that
implement state or federal law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'><b>     SECTION 6.</b>  No part
of the funds appropriated herein shall be used, either directly or indirectly,
for the purpose of paying any clerk, stenographer, assistant, deputy, or other
person who may be related by blood or marriage within the third degree,
computed by the rules of the civil law, to the official employing or having the
right of employment or selection thereof; and in the event of any such payment,
then the official or person approving and making or receiving such payment
shall be jointly and severally liable to return to the State of Mississippi and
to pay into the State Treasury three (3) times any such amount so paid or
received, to be recovered at suit of the Attorney General; provided that when
the relationship is by affinity and the person through whom the relationship
was established is dead, this provision shall not apply.</p>

<p class=LSSFlshRt1-0><b>SECTION 7.</b>  Of the funds appropriated in Section 1
of this act, the Secretary of State may use funds appropriated for the purposes
of defraying litigation expenses associated with the enforcement of the
Mississippi Securities Act, the Regulation of Charitable Solicitations Act, and
the administration of the Public Trust.</p>
