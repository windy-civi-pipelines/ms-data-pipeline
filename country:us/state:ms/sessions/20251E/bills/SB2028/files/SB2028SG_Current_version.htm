<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'>     As used in this section, the
term &quot;Personal Services&quot; shall mean funds provided under the major
object of expenditure category Personal Services for Salaries, Wages, and
Fringe Benefits.  Funds in this category shall not be transferred to any other
category.</p>

Legislature to ensure compliance with the Variable Compensation Plan, as
outlined in Section 25-9-147, Mississippi Code of 1972.  Payment from these
funds shall be in accordance with the Variable Compensation Plan promulgated by
the Mississippi State Personnel Board.  It is the Legislature's intention that
no employee's salary falls below the minimum salary established by the
Mississippi State Personnel Board.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'>     The State Personnel Board
shall determine and publish the projected annual cost of &quot;Personal

appropriated, it shall be the agency's responsibility to ensure that no single
personnel action or combination of personnel actions, when annualized, exceeds
the Fiscal Year 2026 appropriation for &quot;Personal Services&quot; with the
exception of escalated funds.  Further, it shall be the agency's responsibility
to ensure that funds required to be appropriated for &quot;Personal Services&quot;
for Fiscal Year 2027 do not exceed Fiscal Year 2026 funds appropriated for that
purpose unless programs or positions are added to the agency's Fiscal Year 2026
budget by the Mississippi Legislature. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'>     If, at the time the agency
takes any action to change &quot;Personal Services,&quot; the State Personnel
Board determines that the agency has taken or will take an action that would
cause the agency to exceed the funds appropriated in this act when annualized
for Fiscal Year 2026 or increase the need for &quot;Personal Services&quot; for
Fiscal Year 2027, when annualized, the State Personnel Board shall process no
salary actions until such time as the requirements of the provisions of this
section are met with the exception of new hires determined to be essential for
the agency.</p>

Funding&quot; shall mean funds included in the Total Personal Services amount
listed above and designated for approved vacancies in Fiscal Year 2026.  These
funds are to be utilized to increase the number of filled headcounts that were
authorized but unfilled as of the last day of Fiscal Year 2025.  If the agency
fills additional headcounts after May 1, 2025, until the end of Fiscal Year
2025, the amount of available Vacancy Funding may be proportionally reduced to
reflect the updated number of filled headcounts.  The agency shall be
responsible for ensuring that &quot;Vacancy Funding&quot; is used to increase
headcounts and not for promotions, title changes, in-range salary adjustments,
or any other mechanism for increasing salaries for current employees. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'>     Any transfers or escalations
shall be made in accordance with the terms, conditions, and procedures
established by law or allowable under the terms set forth within this act.  The
State Personnel Board shall not escalate positions without written approval
from the Department of Finance and Administration.  The Department of Finance
and Administration shall not provide written approval to escalate any funds for
salaries and/or headcounts without proof of availability of new or additional
funds above the appropriated level.  Unless specifically noted, all Fiscal Year
2025 escalated headcounts have been accounted for and shall be converted to
authorized time-limited headcounts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'>     No general funds authorized
to be expended herein shall be used to replace federal funds and/or other
special funds used for salaries authorized under the provisions of this act and
which are withdrawn and no longer available.</p>

appropriated shall be used in violation of the Internal Revenue Service's
Publication 15-A relating to the reporting of income paid to contract
employees, as interpreted by the Office of the State Auditor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'>     If the agency's total
authorized headcount decreases from Fiscal Year 2025 to Fiscal Year 2026, it
will be the agency's discretion as to what headcounts are removed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'>     The Legislature authorized
three (3) new headcounts, which are included in the authorized headcount above
for Fiscal Year 2026.&nbsp; One (1) headcount for the Program Management and
Support will be utilized by using one (1) FY 2025 existing headcount.</p>
