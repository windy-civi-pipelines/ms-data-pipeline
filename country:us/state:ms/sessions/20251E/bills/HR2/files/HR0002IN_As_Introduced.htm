<h1 align=center style='text-align:center'>House Resolution 2</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>A RESOLUTION COMMENDING AND CONGRATULATING MR. ROGELIO V.
SOLIS FOR HIS REMARKABLE CAREER WITH THE ASSOCIATED PRESS AS CHIEF PHOTOGRAPHER
FOR THE WIRE SERVICE'S JACKSON OFFICE PHOTO.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'>     WHEREAS, veteran
photojournalist Rogelio V. Solis retired from The Associated Press in January
2025 after dedicating nearly three decades as chief photographer for the wire
service's Jackson office; and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'>     WHEREAS, a native of El
Paso, Texas, Mr. Solis has lived in Mississippi since 1970, and he received a
mass communications degree from Jackson State University and a photojournalism
degree from the University of Missouri; and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'>     WHEREAS, before he began
working for The Associated Press, where he won numerous awards for his
photojournalism, Mr. Solis was a photographer with the <i>Meridian Star</i>
newspaper and the <i>Houma Daily Courier</i> in Louisiana, and he also served
for three years as photographer for former Governor Ray Mabus' administration;
and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'>     WHEREAS, through his lens,
Mr. Solis presented Mississippi to the world, as his photographs have been
published locally, nationally and internationally, and he chronicled
Mississippi's most celebrated moments, including monumental sports victories,
and its low points, including the massive destruction of hurricanes and other
natural disasters as well as man-made calamity with criminal cases and trials;
and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'>     WHEREAS, Mr. Solis truly has
a gift for capturing images that convey people's personalities, whether amid
the devastation of Hurricane Katrina or during floor debates in the Mississippi
House and Senate; and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'>     WHEREAS, additionally, Mr.
Solis was a high school classmate and friend of Deborah Hays, who eventually
married Phil Bryant in 1976, and when she became the state's first lady in
January 2012, she provided a thorough tour of the Governor's Mansion for Mr.
Solis, allowing him to capture memorable photos of the historic building,
including from the rooftop; and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'>     WHEREAS, Mr. Solis's
photographs have shown the good, the bad, the ugly and the beautiful, and will
live on as an important visual documentation of the Magnolia State's history,
and he was often recognized by The Associated Press for shooting some of the
most remarkable photos of the day or week nationwide, which received the AP
TopPix designation; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'>     WHEREAS, it is the policy of
the House of Representatives to recognize and commend the tireless devotion to
the betterment of Mississippi and honor the ardent vow to impeccable service
that Mr. Rogelio V. Solis provided to The Associated Press for three decades as
chief photographer for the wire service's Jackson office photo:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'>     NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT
RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI, That we
do hereby commend and congratulate Mr. Rogelio V. Solis for his remarkable
career with The Associated Press as chief photographer for the wire service's
Jackson office photo and extend best wishes for continued success and happiness
in all his future endeavors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'>     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That
copies of this resolution be provided to Mr. Rogelio V. Solis and to the
members of the Capitol Press Corps. </p>
