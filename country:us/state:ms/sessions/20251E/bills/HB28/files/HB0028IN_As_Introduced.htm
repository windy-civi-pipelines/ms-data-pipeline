<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'><span style='color:black'>     As
used in this section, the term Personal Services shall mean funds provided
under the major object of expenditure category Personal Services for Salaries,
Wages, and Fringe Benefits.  Funds in this category shall not be transferred to
any other category.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'><span style='color:black'>     It
is the intention of the Legislature to ensure compliance with the Variable
Compensation Plan, as outlined in Section 25-9-147, Mississippi Code of 1972.
Payment from these funds shall be in accordance with the Variable Compensation
Plan promulgated by the Mississippi State Personnel Board. It is the
Legislatures intention that no employees salary falls below the minimum
salary established by the Mississippi State Personnel Board.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'><span style='color:black'>     The
State Personnel Board shall determine and publish the projected annual cost of
Personal Services based on monthly and year-to-date payroll expenditures in
compliance with the provisions of this act.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'><span style='color:black'>     With
the funds herein appropriated, it shall be the agencys responsibility to
ensure that no single personnel action or combination of personnel actions,
when annualized, exceeds the Fiscal Year 2026 appropriation for Personal
Services with the exception of escalated funds. Further, it shall be the
agencys responsibility to ensure that funds required to be appropriated for Personal
Services for Fiscal Year 2027 do not exceed Fiscal Year 2026 funds
appropriated for that purpose unless programs or positions are added to the
agencys Fiscal Year 2026 budget by the Mississippi Legislature. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'><span style='color:black'>     If,
at the time the agency takes any action to change Personal Services, the
State Personnel Board determines that the agency has taken or will take an
action that would cause the agency to exceed the funds appropriated in this act
when annualized for Fiscal Year 2026 or increase the need for Personal
Services for Fiscal Year 2027, when annualized, the State Personnel Board
shall process no salary actions until such time as the requirements of the
provisions of this section are met with the exception of new hires determined
to be essential for the agency.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'><span style='color:black'>     When
used in this section, Vacancy Funding shall mean funds included in the Total
Personal Services amount listed above and designated for approved vacancies in
Fiscal Year 2026. These funds are to be utilized to increase the number of filled
headcounts that were authorized but unfilled as of the last day of Fiscal Year
2025. If the agency fills additional headcounts after May 1, 2025, until the
end of Fiscal Year 2025, the amount of available Vacancy Funding may be
proportionally reduced to reflect the updated number of filled headcounts. The
agency shall be responsible for ensuring that Vacancy Funding is used to
increase headcounts and not for promotions, title changes, in-range salary
adjustments, or any other mechanism for increasing salaries for current
employees. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'><span style='color:black'>     Any
transfers or escalations shall be made in accordance with the terms,
conditions, and procedures established by law or allowable under the terms set
forth within this act. The State Personnel Board shall not escalate positions
without written approval from the Department of Finance and Administration. The
Department of Finance and Administration shall not provide written approval to
escalate any funds for salaries and/or headcounts without proof of availability
of new or additional funds above the appropriated level. Unless specifically
noted, all Fiscal Year 2025 escalated headcounts have been accounted for and
shall be converted to authorized time-limited headcounts.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'><span style='color:black'>     No
general funds authorized to be expended herein shall be used to replace federal
funds and/or other special funds used for salaries authorized under the
provisions of this act and which are withdrawn and no longer available.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'><span style='color:black'>     None
of the funds herein appropriated shall be used in violation of the Internal
Revenue Services Publication 15-A relating to the reporting of income paid to
contract employees, as interpreted by the Office of the State Auditor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'><span style='color:black'>     If
the agencys total authorized headcount decreases from Fiscal Year 2025 to
Fiscal Year 2026, it will be the agencys discretion as to what headcounts are
removed.</span></p>

<p class=LSSFlshRt1-0><b>SECTION 3.</b>  It is the intention of the Legislature
that the Mississippi Real Estate Commission shall maintain complete accounting
and personnel records related to the expenditure of all funds appropriated
under this act and that such records shall be in the same format and level of
detail as maintained for Fiscal Year 2025.  It is further the intention of the
Legislature that the agency's budget request for Fiscal Year 2027 shall be
submitted to the Joint Legislative Budget Committee in a format and level of
detail comparable to the format and level of detail provided during the Fiscal
Year 2026 budget request process.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'><b>     SECTION 4.</b>  It is the
intention of the Legislature that whenever two (2) or more bids are received by
this agency for the purchase of commodities or equipment, and whenever all
things stated in such received bids are equal with respect to price, quality
and service, the Mississippi Industries for the Blind shall be given preference. 
A similar preference shall be given to the Mississippi Industries for the Blind
whenever purchases are made without competitive bids.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'><b>     SECTION 5.</b>  It is the
intention of the Legislature that the funds herein appropriated shall be
expended in compliance with Section 27-104-25, Mississippi Code of 1972, that
no state agency shall incur obligations or indebtedness in excess of their
appropriation and that the responsible officers, either personally or upon
their official bonds, shall be held responsible for actions contrary to this
provision.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'><b>     SECTION 6.</b>  The money
herein appropriated shall be paid by the State Treasurer out of any money in
the State Treasury to the credit of the proper fund or funds as set forth in
this act, upon warrants issued by the State Fiscal Officer; and the State
Fiscal Officer shall issue his warrants upon requisitions signed by the proper
person, officer or officers, in the manner provided by law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'><b>     SECTION 7.</b>  This act
shall take effect and be in force from and after July 1, 2025.</p>
