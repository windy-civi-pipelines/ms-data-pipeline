<p class=MsoNormal>MISSISSIPPI LEGISLATURE</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2025 1st Extraordinary Session</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To: Rules</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>By: Representative Hines</p>

<h1 align=center style='text-align:center'>House Resolution 1</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>A RESOLUTION MOURNING THE LOSS AND COMMEMORATING THE LIFE,
LEGACY AND SERVICE OF MR. WINFRED JEROME &quot;WIN&quot; CRANE, ASSISTANT
SERGEANT AT ARMS FOR THE MISSISSIPPI HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, AND EXPRESSING
DEEPEST SYMPATHY TO HIS FAMILY AND FRIENDS UPON HIS PASSING.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'>     WHEREAS, it is written in II
Timothy 4:7, &quot;I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I
have kept the faith,&quot; and as such, the immaculate author and finisher of
our souls' destiny summoned the mortal presence of dearly beloved Mr. Winfred
Jerome &quot;Win&quot; Crane to eternal rest on Friday, April 18, 2025,
rendering great sorrow and loss to his family, friends and colleagues; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'>     WHEREAS, the City of Jackson
and the Mississippi House of Representatives, lost a native and lifelong
resident, reliable friend and quiet storm of wisdom with the passing of Mr.
Crane, born on August 21, 1958, to the late Mr. Nathaniel Paul Crane, Sr., and
Mrs. Maggie Mae Crane, and who graduated from Callaway High School before
endeavoring in higher education pursuits at Hinds Community College; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'>     WHEREAS, affectionately
known as &quot;Win&quot; to his family and friends, Mr. Crane's radiant
personality, warm spirit, and signature laugh left an indelible impression on
all who encountered him, and he approached life with a zest that embraced joy,
community and adventure,<a name="_Hlk196985421"> and there is now a </a>solemn
hush in our hearts as we come together to pay our final respects to the memory
of one who has now been called to join that innumerable heavenly caravan; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'>     WHEREAS, Mr. Crane's professional
life was marked by versatility, commitment and excellence, beginning as a
draftsman for Siemens Corporation, followed by his successful establishment and
management of a janitorial services company serving the greater Jackson area,
and culminating in his most recent twenty-one-year tenure as Assistant Sergeant
at Arms for the Mississippi House of Representatives, a role in which he served
with dignity, dedication and loyalty to the people's institution from 2004
until his untimely end-of-watch; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'>     WHEREAS, beyond his
professional accomplishments, Mr. Crane was a man of varied interests and
talents:  a self-taught chef and grill master whose culinary delights, from
signature yeast rolls to his celebrated macaroni and cheese, brought people
together around the table; a lover of classic soul and contemporary music; and
a true car enthusiast, known for both his custom work and his legendary fast
driving, which became family lore; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'>     WHEREAS, at his core,
&quot;Win&quot; was known and loved most for his generosity, humility, and
kindness as a dependable son, devoted brother, fun-loving uncle and cherished
friend whose magnetic spirit uplifted others and brought light into the lives
of many; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'>     WHEREAS, a distinguished
gentleman who has now crossed the chilly waters of Jordan to lay down his flag
and staff of battle to unite with the legions of Heaven's guardian angels who
transitioned before him, including his beloved parents, brother, Nathaniel Paul
Crane, Jr., sister-in-law, Elaine Crane and niece, Alicia Marie Brown; the
legacy of Mr. Crane's memory will continue to be deeply treasured by those who
experienced the depth of his love commitment and compassion for life,
including:  siblings, Dianne Marie (Kenneth) Brown, Sheila Renee Crane and
David Elgin Crane; sister-in-law, Earnestine (Michael) Evans; eight nieces and
nephews, Anna Margaret Crane, Natasha Dianne Brown, Medina Alisha Crane, Maggie
Crane Brown, Nituria Danielle Evans, Nathaniel Paul Crane III, Kenneth Milton
(Martina) Brown, Jr., and John Marcus Brown; and a host of extended relatives,
friends and colleagues; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'>     WHEREAS, we encourage the
Crane family to find solace in the faith that Winfred has fulfilled the purpose
of his appointed time in adherence to the words of II Timothy 4:7-8, &quot;I
have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. 
Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the
righteous Judge, will award to me on that day&quot;; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'>     WHEREAS, it is the policy of
the House of Representatives to honor and pay tribute to the lives of those who
have rendered noble and selfless service to the people of this state, such as
Mr. Crane, whose life was a testament to the power of kindness, loyalty and the
human spirit:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'>     NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT
RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI, That we
do hereby mourn the loss and commemorate the life, legacy, and service of Mr.
Winfred Jerome &quot;Win&quot; Crane, Assistant Sergeant at Arms for the
Mississippi House of Representatives, and express deepest sympathy to his
family and friends upon his passing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'>     BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That
copies of the resolution be furnished to the family of Mr. Winfred Jerome
&quot;Win&quot; Crane and to the members of the Capitol Press Corps.</p>
