agencys responsibility to ensure that funds required to be appropriated for
Personal Services for Fiscal Year 2027 do not exceed Fiscal Year 2026 funds
appropriated for that purpose unless programs or positions are added to the
agencys Fiscal Year 2026 budget by the Mississippi Legislature. </span></p>

Services for Fiscal Year 2027, when annualized, the State Personnel Board
shall process no salary actions until such time as the requirements of the

to be essential for the agency.</span></p>

used in this section, Vacancy Funding shall mean funds included in the Total
Personal Services amount listed above and designated for approved vacancies in
Fiscal Year 2026. These funds are to be utilized to increase the number of
filled headcounts that were authorized but unfilled as of the last day of
Fiscal Year 2025. If the agency fills additional headcounts after May 1, 2025,
until the end of Fiscal Year 2025, the amount of available Vacancy Funding may
be proportionally reduced to reflect the updated number of filled headcounts.
The agency shall be responsible for ensuring that Vacancy Funding is used to
increase headcounts and not for promotions, title changes, in-range salary
adjustments, or any other mechanism for increasing salaries for current
employees. </span></p>

transfers or escalations shall be made in accordance with the terms,
conditions, and procedures established by law or allowable under the terms set
forth within this act. The State Personnel Board shall not escalate positions
without written approval from the Department of Finance and Administration. The
Department of Finance and Administration shall not provide written approval to
escalate any funds for salaries and/or headcounts without proof of availability
of new or additional funds above the appropriated level. Unless specifically
noted, all Fiscal Year 2025 escalated headcounts have been accounted for and
shall be converted to authorized time-limited headcounts.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'><span style='color:black'>     No
general funds authorized to be expended herein shall be used to replace federal

provisions of this act and which are withdrawn and no longer available.</span></p>

the agencys total authorized headcount decreases from Fiscal Year 2025 to
Fiscal Year 2026, it will be the agencys discretion as to what headcounts are

that the Governor's Office&nbsp;-&nbsp;Division of Medicaid shall maintain
complete accounting and personnel records related to the expenditure of all
funds appropriated under this act and that such records shall be in the same
format and level of detail as maintained for Fiscal Year 2025.  It is further
the intention of the Legislature that the agency's budget request for Fiscal
Year 2027 shall be submitted to the Joint Legislative Budget Committee in a
format and level of detail comparable to the format and level of detail
provided during the Fiscal Year 2026 budget request process with the Children's
Health Insurance Program (CHIP) being separated from the Medical Services
Program and submitted as a separate program.  All Medicaid 1915 (C) Home and
Community Based Services Waivers shall be presented as a budget program
separate from the Medical Services Program.  In addition, the performance
measures reported for the Medical Services Program shall include an unduplicated
case count of individuals served by eligibility status, and the number and the
costs of emergency room visits.</p>
