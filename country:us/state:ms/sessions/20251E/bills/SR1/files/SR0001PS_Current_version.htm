Water Resources Committee, Senate Finance Committee, Senate Forestry Committee,

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'>     WHEREAS, Senator Jordan's

benefited teachers; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'>     WHEREAS, David Jordan's long
service has been marked by his commitment to success and recognized leadership. 
He excelled in a variety of major responsibilities and served the Senate, his
constituents, and the state exceptionally well.  Senator Jordan's public
service has been exemplified by sound judgment and fairness, and he set the
highest standard in all of his many roles, as a father, husband, grandfather,
educator, citizen, statesman, and leader in the Mississippi Delta and in the
Mississippi Senate, and as a true friend:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:24.0pt'>     NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT
RESOLVED BY THE SENATE OF THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI, That we do hereby recognize
and commend the outstanding leadership of District 24 State Senator David L.
Jordan for his distinguished service in the Mississippi Senate on the occasion
of his retirement and extend to Senator Jordan and his family the best wishes
